# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 * Figuring out optimal ways for everyone to meet, so everyone is updated with project decisions
 * Deciding about the messaging/chat feature for the product
 * Using the info from use cases/UI/features list to assist with development
 * delegate front-end/back-end tasks based on people's experience/interest
 
 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
