# PairWise

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 4:15 pm, Friday February 9th 2018
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology, Room 3200 

## Process - Reflection

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Slack 
 * Tutorial meetings
 * Assignment to different tasks

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 > **meeting time (outside of tutorials):** We tried to decide the time for meetings and the review session last weekend through Doodle. However, we cannot find a suitable time for our meetings from the result that we get from Doodle. Therefore, we arranged the review meeting a little later than what we expected.
 
 > **GitHub task board:** We were planning on use the projects feature that Github provided. In the projects feature, there are To-Do list tab, in progress tab and done tab. We thought it would be useful for orginizing our project, and update the status of each individual work. However, at the end, we did not make of good use of the the projects feature.
 
 > **Upload context to GitHub from Google Docs:** We were collaborating work through Google Docs for this diliverable. During the process that we were uploading the context in the Google Docs, we ran into few synchronized problem which is one of us uploading the context when soomeone is still working on the context. Google Docs does not send out a clear notefication for changes. 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
 * find a better way to meet
 * integrate GitHub into Slack
 * test out organization system between task board and ladder

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Features List
 * Use Case diagram
 * UI
 * survey
 
 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

> **Using a task management system:** We had two different ideas for planning tasks, monitoring their progress, and registering their completion. The first is a ticket ladder document using Google Docs, which Alex has used effectively in other contexts. The second is using a GitHub project board, which is unfamiliar to most team members, but offers smoother integration with GitHub (connecting tasks to issues and pull requests, etc.). We intended to try both methods, but we did not take the time to plan a standard task workflow that everyone should adhere to. As such, we found ourselves communicating primarily over Slack about who was working on a task at a given time. This was ineffective, as people didn't always know if certain tasks had been delegated or completed. We agree that we should try each system, come to consensus on the most effective option, and utilize that system going forward.

> **Using GitHub integration in Slack:** As described in the previous section, choosing Slack as our primary means of communication has been successful. To further improve our workflow, we planned to use Slack's GitHub integration to automatically notify team members about commits and pull requests. We have not yet been able to accomplish this as we are waiting for approval from the GitHub organization administrators, but we hope to take advantage of this feature in the next iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 * Figuring out optimal ways for everyone to meet, so everyone is updated with project decisions
 * Deciding about the messaging/chat feature for the product
 * Using the info from use cases/UI/features list to assist with development
 * delegate front-end/back-end tasks based on people's experience/interest
 
 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
