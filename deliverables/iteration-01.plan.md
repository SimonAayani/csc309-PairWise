# PairWise



## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Feb. 1, 2018
 * End date: Feb. 9, 2018

## Process


### Roles & responsibilities

>* **Features List, Priorities and Goals:**  
> The basic framework of the features and functions of the PairWise partner finding application. This consists of the features and goals necessary to achieve the Minimum Viable Product including login/logout, user profile creation, a competent search students feature, group formation/deletion as well as a chat feature. An additional list of extra features brainstormed for design extensibility. 
>* Contributors: Evan Wallace (epwallace), Simon Aayani (SimonAayani)


>* **User Stories, Use Cases and Personas:**
> An analysis of the usability of the PairWise application. This includes information about all users/stakeholders of the application, a use case model of the interactions between the multiple users and the application. Personas of potential student users included to get a shared understanding of multiple types of users (in terms of goals and capabilities).
>* Contributors: Yuhua Li (NaClSalt), Cindy Wang (cwang0802)

  
>* **UI Design:**
> An artifact that describes the working design of the PairWise product. It tests how appealing and interactive the PairWise product is as it includes a visual placement of multiple brainstormed features, including tools like online chat and search.
>* Contributors: Alex Hurka (ahurka), Deanne Madulid (deannemadulid)


>* **The Ladder:**
> An artifact specifically for group organization and communication purposes, to make sure goals and deadlines are met. 
>* Contributors: Alex Hurka (ahurka)


>* **GitHub and Slack SetUp:**
> Creation of a workspace for the group to organize tasks and communicate about project activity. 
>* Contributors: Evan Wallace (epwallace)


>* **Survey:**
> An artifact created to get an idea of how students find course discussion boards to find partners, if they are able to find a partner and if they were satisfied with working with the partner they found. The survey’s main purpose is to reassure the major problems with students ability to find compatible partners.
>* Contributors: Deanne Madulid (deannemadulid), Priyanka Narasimhan (PriyankaNarasi)
>* **Note:** This task was assigned near the end of the iteration, long after the planning meeting. For that reason it does not appear in any sections below. However, the team members who wrote and deployed the survey deserve credit for their work.


#### Events

Description of meetings (and other events) we are planning to have:

  > We will hold two team meetings per week, one during tutorial on Thursday (in person) and the other on Mondays through Slack at 4:00 pm. We are considering adding one more in-person meeting on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, depending on everyone’s schedule. The purpose of these meetings will be to update the team on progress made to the project, as well as raise any concerns or planning decisions. In general, the meetings will function in the same way as scrum standups.
  > On Friday, February 9, we will hold our review meeting for the first iteration.

#### Artifacts

Description of the process related artifacts we will produce:

  > We will use GitHub's project taskboard to organize our backlog of tasks (features, defects, documentation...etc.) This system will remain up-to-date with our repository. We will also use a [Ladder system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSICkmNKqWTZWZ_YjbdnL1I6kxU0awre4iaVYLc47ds) in parallel to this, as another place to track the progress of our tasks. See Highlights section of [product.md](./product.md) for more details.
  > We are looking into integrating the team's project workspace on Slack with GitHub, to notify the rest of the team when important events happen to the repository and the project. Currently the Slack workspace is used for group communications, file transfer, and as a site for online team meetings.

## Product


#### Goals and tasks
  >* **Settle on product idea and problem domain:**
  > We will have to pinpoint the exact nature of our product and what specific problem we are ultimately solving
  >
  >* **Identify users, develop personas and user stories:**
  > Firstly, we must identify our target audience for our website, and then create end-user perspectives on features that would be necessary in order to create a competitive product.
  >
  >* **Decide on website features:**
  > Outline all the functionality that our web application will be providing, focusing on things that will make us stand out compared to the alternatives.
  >
  >* **Prioritize website features:**
  > Implement an ordered list of most important functions/features to be implemented such that we do not run out of time
  >
  >* **Convert features into ticket lists:**
  > Essentially lay out our “to-do”s in a low level (preferably function level) list, so that we can differentiate between what is being done, and what needs to be done.
  >
  >* **Develop use cases:**
  > Create diagrams that illustrate the steps users (actors) must take in order to achieve certain goals on our website
  >
  >* **Design webpage layout:**
  > Organize our ideas into an easily navigable, and clean user interface. 

### Artifacts

Product Artifacts created as of yet:

#### Features List

> A file will be used to organized high-level features that may be implemented in the project.
> Some of these features will be crucial to the functionality of PairWise; these will be
> marked as core features. The core features comprise the MVP. In addition, bonus features
> will be listed, which can be implemented if time permits. Having the features list will help
> in developing use cases, as well as establishing defined boundaries for the project.

#### Use Cases

> A simple graph of use cases will be made, to structure and further define application features.
> This diagram will offer some direction on which features to implement first (through
> includes/extends relationships). It will further define the boundaries and structure of the
> project, and how the user would interact with the program. Finally, it can be used as a basis
> for creating the product backlog.

#### Mock Webpage UI

> A mockup of the website's main page layout will be made, to give a reference for front-end
> developers to use while implementing the website's user interface. This way the front-end team
> will not need to design the page as they go, and will be able to implement the page much faster.
> Additionally, the art style used in the main webpage will determine the style used in other pages
> throughout the application, such as sign-in and profile setup pages.
