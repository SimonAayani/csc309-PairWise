# PairWise

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Feb. 1, 2018
 * End date: Feb. 8, 2018

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._

#### Roles & responsibilities

* Features List and Priorities: Evan + Simon
* User Stories + Use Cases: Salt
* Personas: Cindy
* UI Design: Alex + Deanne?
* The Ladder: Alex
* Survey: Priyanka + Deanne

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

* We will hold two team meetings per week, one during tutorial on Thursday (in-person) and the other on Mondays through Slack at 4:00 pm.
* We are considering adding one more in-person meeting on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, depending on everyoneâ€™s schedule
* The purpose of these meetings will be to update the team on progress made to the project, as well as raise any concerns
* On Friday, February 9, we will hold our review meeting for the first iteration

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

* We will use GitHub's project taskboard to organize our backlog of tasks (features, defects, documentation...etc.)
* We will also use a [Ladder system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSICkmNKqWTZWZ_YjbdnL1I6kxU0awre4iaVYLc47ds) in parallel to this, as another place to track the progress of our tasks

## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks

> * `Add` merged features list
> * `Add` user stories

* Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
* Order the items from most to least important.
* Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
   
   > Below is a mockup of the main webpage for the application. This mockup was made to give a reference for front-end developers to use while implementing the website's user interface. This way the front-end team will not need to design the page as they go, and will be able to implement the page much faster. Additionally, the mockup helped direct the making of use cases by concretely showing which buttons the user may use to interact with the application. Finally, it settled an art style that can be used in other pages throughout the application.
