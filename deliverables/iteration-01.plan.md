# PairWise

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Feb. 1, 2018
 * End date: Feb. 9, 2018

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._

#### Roles & responsibilities

  `TODO` Expand the following with descriptions

  * Features List and Priorities: Evan + Simon
  * User Stories + Use Cases: Salt
  * Personas: Cindy
  * UI Design: Alex + Deanne?
  * The Ladder: Alex
  * Survey: Priyanka + Deanne

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

  > We will hold two team meetings per week, one during tutorial on Thursday (in person) and the other on Mondays through Slack at 4:00 pm. We are considering adding one more in-person meeting on Tuesdays or Wednesdays, depending on everyoneâ€™s schedule. The purpose of these meetings will be to update the team on progress made to the project, as well as raise any concerns or planning decisions. In general, the meetings will function in the same way as scrum standups.
  > On Friday, February 9, we will hold our review meeting for the first iteration.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

  > We will use GitHub's project taskboard to organize our backlog of tasks (features, defects, documentation...etc.) This system will remain up-to-date with our repository. We will also use a [Ladder system](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSICkmNKqWTZWZ_YjbdnL1I6kxU0awre4iaVYLc47ds) in parallel to this, as another place to track the progress of our tasks. See Highlights section of [product.md](./product.md) for more details.
  > We are looking into integrating the team's project workspace on Slack with GitHub, to notify the rest of the team when important events happen to the repository and the project. Currently the Slack workspace is used for group communications, file transfer, and as a site for online team meetings.

## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks
  * Settle on product idea and problem domain
    * We will have to pinpoint the exact nature of our product and what specific problem we are ultimately solving
  * Identify users, develop personas and user stories
	* Firstly, we must identify our target audience for our website, and then create end-user perspectives on features that would be necessary in order to create a competitive product.


  * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
  * Order the items from most to least important.
  * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

The artifacts created as of yet:

* Survey Information. A survey was conducted to several Computer Science students at UofT, which gathered information about the effectiveness of the 'partner finding feature' in current course discussion boards. Questions regarding the issues with such discussion boards including poor communication, difficulty of forming groups, or inability to find compatible partners were also asked. The results of the survey were reassuring, and further supported the necessity of building a school parter finding application. 

* Use Case diagram provided. The diagram displays the set of all actions that can be performed by the external users of the PairWise product. It provides a detailed visual of all interactions and functions to be implemented.
 
  * Below is a mockup of the main webpage for the application. This mockup was made to give a reference for front-end developers to use while implementing the website's user interface. This way the front-end team will not need to design the page as they go, and will be able to implement the page much faster. Additionally, the mockup helped direct the making of use cases by concretely showing which buttons the user may use to interact with the application. Finally, it settled an art style that can be used in other pages throughout the application.
