# PairWise

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Feb. 12, 2018
 * End date: Mar. 9, 2018

## Process

> One of the aims of this iteration was to find a suitable workflow and organizational structure for development. We intend to test various systems and refine our process, settling on an optimally productive process for future iterations. In particular, finding times to hold group meetings is still an issue, as there is no time during weekdays that the group can all be present. By breaking up responsibilities into discrete sections, we will minimize the need for developers on different sections to interact with those on other sections, thus reducing the need for all members of the team to meet at once regularly. Additionally, we were intending to use this deliverable to find an ideal organization system, by choosing between GitHub's project taskboard and a custom-designed project ladder. Settling on the best options will leave the team well-prepared for the upcoming final iteration.

#### Roles & responsibilities

> In this deliverable, the roles and responsibilities were more focused on the analysis of requirements, design and development of the product. Group members were assigned multiple roles that provided experience in both design and development. 


>* **Requirements Analysts:**
> Analysts will be responsible of collecting and analyzing brainstormed project ideas and turning them into clear technical specifications that the group can consult. Expectations for this role include gathering and maintaining information about functional requirements, communicating the requirements to group members and provide necessary documentation that describe the features and scope of the PairWise product. Questions worth asking include:  
> - What features will exist for the MVP and why they should exist?
> - What goals will a user accomplish with a certain feature?
> - What is the ultimate goal/purpose of the product?
> - What architecture/software development tools will be used to create the product?
>* Contributors: Evan Wallace (epwallace), Alex Hurka (ahurka)

>* **UX Designers:** 
> This role requires gathering functional user requirements to specify how product features can and should be implemented. UX designers must decide the web application structure, design the layout between the different user pages and the placement of the features throughout the product. They may write user stories and review use cases to describe user behaviour when the application is use, while also deciding whether the product’s structure is efficient and helps resolve problems the target audience faces. 
>* Contributors: Simon Aayani (SimonAayani), Deanne Madulid (deannemadulid), Priyanka Narasimhan (PriyankaNarasi)

>* **UI Designers:** 
> Responsibilities cover all visual aspects of the web application including colour scheme, font, and overall style. The UI designer may also design logo, include animations and make decisions about using different fonts for differentiating sections of the application. 
>* Contributors: Yuhua Li (NaClSalt), Cindy Wang (cwang0802)

> Since it was decided that deliverable 2 would be more focused on client-side interaction, the majority of group members were assigned front-end development tasks. Tasks were split up in such a way that had each group member create and deploy different pages/views in the PairWise web application.  

>* **HTML and CSS Developers:**  
> Transform the product visuals and design into code. Create HTML and CSS files for each page view of the web application. All features part of the design must be visually present, without functionality. All pages/views in the web application must be correctly formatted as described by the UI. 
>* Contributors: Yuhua Li (NaClSalt), Cindy Wang (cwang0802), Simon Aayani (SimonAayani), Deanne Madulid (deannemadulid), Evan Wallace (epwallace), Priyanka Narasimhan (PriyankaNarasi)

>* **Frontend Developers:** 
> Responsibilities include implementing functionality solely for the front end/client-side. The product consists of many pages that must acquire and submit information (ie. Registration, Login, Profile Creation, Group Creation..etc). The click of a button should submit information through a contact form through the use of JavaScript. Front-end developers must ensure fully-functioning buttons and forms in the web application’s interface.

>* **Backend Developer:** 
> Though this deliverable is not heavily focused on backend development, the responsibilities of the backend developer in this iteration is to create a setup for backend development to use in the next deliverable. This includes understanding how to install and use the Django framework, exploring and integrating the different features Django provides including the login feature and basic setup of database schemas.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

> Salt
 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

> Deanne
 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

> Evan
Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

> Cindy
 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

> Simon
List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
