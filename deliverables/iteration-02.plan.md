## Iteration 02

 * Start date: Feb. 12, 2018
 * End date: Mar. 9, 2018

## Process

> One of the aims of this iteration was to find a suitable workflow and organizational structure for development. We intend to test various systems and refine our process, settling on an optimally productive process for future iterations. In particular, finding times to hold group meetings is still an issue, as there is no time during weekdays that the group can all be present. By breaking up responsibilities into discrete sections, we will minimize the need for developers on different sections to interact with those on other sections, thus reducing the need for all members of the team to meet at once regularly. Additionally, we were intending to use this deliverable to find an ideal organization system, by choosing between GitHub's project taskboard and a custom-designed project ladder. Settling on the best options will leave the team well-prepared for the upcoming final iteration.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

> Priya

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

> Salt
 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

> Deanne
 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

> Evan
Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

> Cindy
 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

> Simon
List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
