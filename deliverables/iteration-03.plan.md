## Iteration 3

 * Start date: Mar. 18, 2018
 * End date: Mar. 18, 2018

## Process

>Looking back at the last two iterations, and comparing the process methods for both, we are able to see vast improvements in the project workflow and organizational structure for development. Notably, the software tools that were used for communication and organization purposes including Slack’s GitHub integration and GitHub issues turned out to be extremely useful as it provided us with updated information about assigned tasks, file changes and code bugs. We plan to continue using these tools during this deliverable. In regards to the group’s organization, our plan for the last deliverable was to assign the major role of Frontend Developer to multiple group members, where each group member had the responsibility to implement a certain user view in the webpage. However, because we had not outlined clear standards for code, it lead to incredibly different unmergeable implementations. This strategy was indeed inefficient as it lead to a lot of unused code, wasted time and the group having to re-implement much of the frontend work in the little time that was left. Clearly, group organization is still an issue, and we plan to find an optimal strategy to divide up work within the given time frame.

#### Changes from previous iteration

>* **Delegation of Roles:**
>Delegation of roles is a main priority in this deliverable, as our strategy to delegate multiple group members to a single role in the previous deliverable was not as successful as it could have been. Although splitting up frontend tasks by the different user pages may have been a good idea, the strategy was not successful because the members were not provided clear enough specifications about how to implement the user page they were given. Hence delegation in the final deliverable will focus on assigning responsibilities and authority to group members in order to complete a clearly defined and agreed upon task, which will be followed up upon by other group members to track progress, successes and failures. Specifications for each task will be decided by all group members including which software/tools to build with, goals, functionalities and outcomes. 

>* **Meetings:**
>In the last deliverable we found having in-person coding sessions over the weekends to be quite useful as we were able to ask questions to each other and solve code bugs quicker. However we were not able to have enough coding sessions as we wanted to. We are planning to have more in-person coding sessions spread throughout the next few weeks to ensure that group members have ample time to discuss/assign tasks, work on tasks, and share progress. If necessary, we also aim to have a few coding sessions on weekdays. 

>* **Create a Measurable Organization System:**
>It would be unreasonable to assign major tasks like implementing a search algorithm, or connecting frontend with backend to a single group member to complete. Not only does it risk failure to complete the task, but also does not allow enough time for learning. So we have decided to create a step-by-step system that outlines the small steps and processes needed to be completed to ensure the desired outcome. Group members will be assigned smarter and measurable tasks, and will be given earlier deadlines for said tasks spread throughout the next few weeks. This way, we will have a steady flow of development of new features; this process will allow time for any errors/problems faced or learning curves and avoid last minute work, while still keeping the project on track. 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the **purpose** of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be to-do lists, task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow.     
Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share a codebase and avoid conflicts.

 * Be concise, yet precise.      
For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow.



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
